# Image-Based Recommendation System using ResNet-50 and Cosine Similarity

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code for an Image-Based Recommendation System that utilizes the ResNet-50 deep learning model as a feature extractor and employs cosine similarity to find the top ```k``` similar embeddings for a given input image. 

The system aims to provide users with personalized recommendations based on the visual content of the image provided.

## Features
- Utilizes the powerful ResNet-50 model pre-trained on the imagenet dataset for feature extraction.
- Employs cosine distance as the similarity metric for finding similar embeddings.
- Returns the top ```k``` most similar images based on the cosine similarity score.
- Easy-to-use and adaptable codebase.

# Requirements

- ```Python 3.x```
- ```tensorflow ==2.5.0```
- ```numpy==1.21.0```
- ```streamlit```
- ```pillow==8.3.1```
- ```pandas```
